# ðŸŽ® AR Metaverse - NFT Loot Box ðŸŽ®

This week we bring you a tutorial about how to create an AR Metaverse with Unity and Moralis. We will place and open a loot box, mint the item inside and see it on our MetaMask as an NFT. At the end we will build it to an Android Device and test the result. Enjoy!!
